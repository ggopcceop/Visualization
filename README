I proposed a visualization system to visualize players’ actions in Minecraft game. This system can help game developers or game administrators to have a better overall understanding about players in the game world. In this system, they can view players’ actions in a map like system. The map can zoom larger to view more detail with in a region. There is other chart that visualize those same data based on different height level. Combining those two charts’ information, we can see where the player activities in the 3D world are.
